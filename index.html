        <p>
            I started coding robots in highschool for competitions. In college I wandered into the other realms of Computer Science such as 
            Data Science/ Machine Learning, and Web Development with various software. I worked on 3 Web Development teams for University and 
            college, one which I lead and published a paper. On each team I played a different role project lead/ asp.net programmer, backend
            and fullstack developer.

            Having wokred with web development in various projects has inspired me to continue to build my skillset in the field and
            pursue a career oriented around such skills. My focus is building websites which exceed the standard and are sleek in design.
            
            Other than coding I love to start my day with long runs and end it with a fun bass and trombone jam sesh!
