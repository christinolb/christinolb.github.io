            This is where I will have a short description of where I am, what I've done, how I got here and a little bit about me.

            I started coding robots in highschool for competitions. In college I wandered into the other realms of Computer Science such as 
            Data Science/ Machine Learning, and Web Development with various software. I worked on 3 Web Development teams for University and 
            college, one which I lead, I have 2 published papers... (summarize your acomplishments).
