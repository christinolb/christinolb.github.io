# Christino's Web Portfolio
**Showcase of my web develoment skills and work done while studying Computer Science**

*********

## Description

I created a simple static website with a starter page and a bookmark for my experience and the resulting work from each. Some complete, others never got finished but each resulted in a lot learned and improvement as a student and developer.

#### Technologies

Given that I was already familiar with HTML, JavaScript and CSS, learning React and tailwindcss was very straightforward. I decieded to learn these frameworks because they made building my portfolio much easier. The first time I build a webpage using the regular HTML and CSS it was much more time consuming than React and tailwindcss. Being able to make reuseable components as opposed to refactoring saved a lot of time and was fun! As well as the shorthand CSS which I found easy to memorize made the design and layout aspect much easier with less google search, everything I needed was in the documentation which is very well written. Vite was also very straight forward, with a few commands I was able to get all my tech working together and in a local server in seconds.

#### Challenges

I struggled with keeping things simple in the design of my web portfolio. I was over ambitious at first which led to me try and make the most intricate and captivating portfolio despite this being my first time. I ran into road blocks trying to do complex and moving parts and had to humble myself time after time until I submitted. I realized that I can always build upon what I have, as long as I have something to build upon! Thus I built a static site which gets the job done and piece by piece I will add cool animations and more customizations to fully express myself. I hope to add snap scrolling, moving text as users scroll down and a more captivating color scheme.
